# elevatorSim

This is going to be an interactive elevator simulation that allows the user to explore different algorithmic approaches to Elevator Group Control Systems (EGCS).

**These approaches will (probably) include:**
- SCAN / "Elevator Algorithm" - for a simulation with only one elevator
- fuzzy logic
- various heuristics
- optimization-based algorithms
- predictive algorithms - for simulations with multiple elevators

**Users will be able to control:**
- the number of floors
- the number of elevators
- the usability of elevators (meaning that users can break elevators)

**Different metrics** might be recorded to highlight the efficiency of different approaches (e.g., average waiting time, time to destination, energy consumption, average idle time).
